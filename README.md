# DeepBrainIPP: An end-to-end pipeline for automated mouse brain structures segmentation and morphology analysis.

# Background
DeepBrainIpp is a pipeline for skull stripping, brain structures segmentation and morphogenetic characterization. People with/without technical expertise can use DeepBrainIPP. For Non-computational research staff a system administrator can setup four components (Web Application, Job Manager, Singularity Repository, Computing Node) of DeepBrainIPP to access it via web browser. However, DeepBrainIPP can be used from command prompt/terminal too.

# User guidance
  
  Using DeepBrainIPP from web interface:<br/>
    Setting up web application:<br/>
        1. Setup IPP from https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/jacs-cm <br/>
        2. Setup singularity registry server from https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/docs/setup/#pancakes-installation <br/>
        3. Upload trained models from 'models' directory to singularity registry server <br/>
        4. Configure pipeline in the Admin section <br/>
