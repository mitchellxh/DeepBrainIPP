# DeepBrainIPP: An end-to-end pipeline for automated mouse brain structures segmentation and morphology analysis.

DeepBrainIpp is a pipeline for skull stripping, brain structures segmentation and morphogenetic characterization. People with/without technical expertise can use DeepBrainIPP. For Non-computational research staff a system administrator can setup four components (Web Application, Job Manager, Singularity Repository, Computing Node) of DeepBrainIPP to access it via web browser. However, DeepBrainIPP can be used from command prompt/terminal too.
